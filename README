Ham::APRS::DeviceID
===================

DeviceID - An APRS device identifier

This module attempts to identify the manufacturer, model and 
software version of an APRS transmitter. It looks at details found
in the parsed APRS packet (as provided by Ham::APRS::FAP) and updates
the hash with the identification information, if possible.

The module comes with a device identification database, which is
simply a copy of the YAML master file maintained separately at:

https://github.com/hessu/aprs-deviceid

The device identification database is available in YAML, JSON and
XML formats for use in other applications and programming languages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires a reasonably recent Ham::APRS::FAP module, YAML::Tiny to
load the device identification database and File::ShareDir for finding it.
